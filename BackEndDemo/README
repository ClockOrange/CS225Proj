Environment: Maven, Java JDK 1.8, node, npm
Editor: IntelliJ idea
Bug: need to fix SSL ERROR 

Note: 
Demo works on model "Product"
back-end url: localhost:8080
front-end url: localhost:3000

for "Front" folders, need to install node and npm inorder to install "node_models" on the project route.
(for more details could rearch about install React app)
