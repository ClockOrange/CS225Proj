Environment: Maven, Java JDK 1.8, node, npm, MySql
Editor: IntelliJ idea
Bug: need to fix SSL ERROR 
      But APT URL still works if type in as "localhost:3000/api/allproduct" 

Note: 
Demo works on model "Product"
back-end url: localhost:8080
front-end url: localhost:3000


for "Front" folders, need to install node and npm inorder to install "node_models" on the project route.
(for more details could rearch about install React app)
