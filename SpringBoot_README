Required environment:
- maven, mysql, java jdk 1.8

Should modified:
- file "application.properties" should modified to fit your local mysql server
  spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/.....
  spring.datasource.username = .....
  spring.datasource.password = .....

- file "data.sql" could generate temporary queries. Could be removed if has all required tables locally
  The "Products" table in this version only contains two attributes for tesing only
  Coulc modify "Products" in the model file, add more attrubutes.
  Note that the class name in under model folder should be same as in the databse table
 
- file "WebConfig" 
  Add more file path to the strcuture if you need add more front-end folders under
 
How to run on locally:
- cd to the project folder
- mvn clean
- mvn install
- java -jar target/TEST-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- open http://localhost:8080

WAR file:
- packaging war file has not been tested yet
- could modify pom.xml file by adding
  1. <packaging>war</packaging>
  2.  <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

Future work:
1. Need to debug with "completed order view", should turn "red".
2. Need test and debug with query "select completed date DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAYS)"
3. Need to test oackaging WAR file and the connections with cloud server
